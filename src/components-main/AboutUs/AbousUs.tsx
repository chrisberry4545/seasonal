    <TextLarge style={ styleAboutUsText }>
      Eat Seasonal started because we wanted a way to easily see what fruit
      and vegetables are in seasons. Walking around a supermarket, trying to
      plan seasonal meals becomes much easier when you can quickly access
      information on everything that's in season through your phone.

    <TextLarge style={ styleAboutUsText }>
      The app and website give you quick and simple view of all the food
      currently in seasons. They also provide a recipes section including
      carefully selected recipes which use ingredients which are mostly in
      seasons. New recipes are being added all the time!
